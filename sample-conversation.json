The conflict was between the Norman-French army, led by William the Conqueror, and the English army under Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. Despite strong resistance, King Harold was killed in the battle and William emerged victorious. This marked the beginning of Norman rule in England."

	},
	{
		"bot": "The Magna Carta, which means 'The Great Charter', was signed in 1215. King John of England agreed to it under the pressure of rebellious barons who were unhappy with his rule. The document was a series of written promises between the king and his subjects that he, the king, would govern England and deal with its people according to the customs of feudal law. It's often considered as a cornerstone in the development of democratic rights and the rule of law.                                                                                               The French Revolution was a major period of social and political upheaval that took place in France from 1789 to 1799. It was characterised by radical changes in the government, society, and culture of France, marked by the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a republic, and eventually the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. The French Revolution had a significant impact on global trade, including the trade of Indian goods. Prior to the revolution, France had established a strong colonial presence in India through its various trading companies, most notably the French East India Company. French traders were actively involved in the import and export of goods between India and France."
